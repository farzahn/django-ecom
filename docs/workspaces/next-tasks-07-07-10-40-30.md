# Next Tasks Report: Add Test Products to Pasargad Prints E-commerce Site

**Generated**: 2025-07-07 10:40:30  
**Target**: Add test products with iStock placeholder images  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current Status**: Platform ready for product testing

## Summary

The pasargadprints e-commerce platform has reached a production-ready state with comprehensive backend infrastructure, secure payment processing, and a complete frontend experience. However, the site currently has **zero products** in the database, making it impossible for users to test the shopping experience. Adding test products with professional placeholder images is essential for demonstrating the platform's capabilities and enabling comprehensive testing of the complete user journey from browsing to purchase.

**Key Context:**
- Platform is technically complete and fully operational
- All major features implemented: authentication, cart, checkout, payments, shipping
- Database shows 0 products currently
- Product models and admin interface are properly configured
- Frontend product display components are implemented but untested with real data

## Clarifications

### Product Content Questions
1. **Product Authenticity**: Should test products represent actual 3D printed items that could realistically be sold, or generic placeholder content?

2. **Price Realism**: What price range accurately reflects 3D printed custom items market positioning ($10-100+ range)?

3. **Technical Specifications**: How detailed should product dimensions and weight specifications be for shipping calculations?

4. **Inventory Levels**: What stock quantities should be set for testing inventory management and low-stock scenarios?

### Image and Content Strategy
1. **iStock License**: Are we using iStock images for temporary development/testing only, or do they need commercial licensing?

2. **Image Quality Standards**: What resolution and optimization standards should be maintained for consistent performance?

3. **Product Photography Style**: Should images follow a consistent style guide (backgrounds, lighting, angles) for professional appearance?

4. **Content Tone**: What brand voice should product descriptions use (technical, friendly, premium, accessible)?

### Technical Implementation
1. **Bulk Import Method**: Should products be added manually through admin, or create a management command for bulk import?

2. **Image Storage**: Continue using local media storage for development, or configure cloud storage (AWS S3) for testing?

3. **SEO Considerations**: Should product slugs and descriptions be optimized for search engines even in testing phase?

4. **Performance Testing**: At what product count should we test pagination, search, and filtering performance?

## 中文报告

### 状态概述
pasargadprints电商平台已达到生产就绪状态，具备完整的后端基础设施、安全支付处理和完整的前端体验。然而，网站当前数据库中有**零个产品**，使用户无法测试购物体验。添加带有专业占位图像的测试产品对于展示平台功能和全面测试从浏览到购买的完整用户旅程至关重要。

### 任务清单
按优先级排序的任务包括：
- 高优先级：产品内容策略制定、iStock图像采购准备
- 中优先级：创建产品数据库条目、配置产品图像、测试前端产品显示
- 低优先级：测试完整购物流程、创建产品变体

### 参考资料
- 产品模型：`/store/models.py` - 产品和产品图像模型
- 管理界面：`/store/admin.py` - 带图像管理的产品管理
- API端点：`/store/views.py` - 产品视图集
- 前端组件：产品页面、产品详情页、主页

### 待澄清问题
1. 产品真实性：测试产品应该代表实际可销售的3D打印物品还是通用占位符内容？
2. 价格现实性：什么价格范围准确反映3D打印定制物品的市场定位？
3. 技术规格：产品尺寸和重量规格应该多详细以用于运费计算？
4. 图像许可：我们使用iStock图像仅用于临时开发/测试，还是需要商业许可？
