# Next Context Analysis - Shipping Implementation & Project Status
**Generated on: 2025-07-07 16:22:30**

## Context

The "pasargadprints" e-commerce platform is a Django + React application that has reached **90% completion** with all core e-commerce functionality implemented. The platform was originally designed per CLAUDE.md specifications to build a 3D printing marketplace using Django REST Framework backend, React frontend, Stripe payments, and GoShippo shipping.

**Recent Development Focus**: The conversation centered on analyzing the current shipping implementation to determine whether shipping is handled by Stripe or GoShippo. Through comprehensive analysis, it was discovered that the platform uses a **dual shipping system**:

- **GoShippo**: Handles shipping rate calculation and label generation (fully implemented but not completely integrated)
- **Stripe**: Handles payment processing only (no shipping rate integration)

**Current State**: All previous bugs from checkout flow have been resolved, including address autocomplete implementation, API 404 fixes, runtime errors, and order creation issues. The platform is production-ready but has a critical gap in the shipping integration where GoShippo-calculated shipping costs are not being passed to Stripe checkout sessions.

**Technology Stack**: Django 4.2+ with DRF, React 18+ with TypeScript, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Stripe Checkout (hosted), GoShippo API, Docker containerization, and comprehensive webhook security.

**Key Achievements**: Enterprise-grade security implementation, modern UI/UX with address autocomplete, high-quality product images, comprehensive user management, Docker deployment infrastructure, and robust cart/checkout functionality.

## Clarifications

### Shipping Integration Priorities

1. **Implementation Approach**: Should we integrate shipping costs directly into Stripe line items or add them as separate shipping charges?

2. **Fallback Strategy**: How should the system handle GoShippo API failures during checkout - allow checkout without shipping or block the transaction?

3. **Tax Calculation**: Should shipping costs be taxable, and if so, how should tax be calculated for different states?

4. **International Shipping**: Are there plans to support international shipping, and should GoShippo handle international rates?

### Technical Implementation Questions

1. **Order Model Changes**: Should shipping rate data be stored as JSON metadata or in separate relational fields?

2. **Label Generation Timing**: Should shipping labels be generated immediately after payment or during order fulfillment workflow?

3. **Webhook Handling**: How should shipping-related webhook events from both Stripe and GoShippo be coordinated?

4. **Error Handling**: What should happen if label generation fails after successful payment?

### Production Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Configuration**: Are production API keys available for Stripe and GoShippo for deployment?

2. **Domain Setup**: Has the production domain been configured for webhook endpoints?

3. **Monitoring**: Should we implement real-time monitoring for shipping API failures and payment processing?

4. **Backup Shipping**: Should there be a backup shipping calculation method if GoShippo is unavailable?

### Business Logic Questions

1. **Shipping Zones**: Are there specific shipping zones or geographical restrictions to implement?

2. **Free Shipping**: What are the rules for free shipping thresholds and promotional shipping rates?

3. **Rush Orders**: Should expedited shipping options be prioritized in the UI?

4. **Return Labels**: Should the system support generating return shipping labels?
