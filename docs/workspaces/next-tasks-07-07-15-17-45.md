### Related Commits
- **Latest Commit**: `67303c2 - feat: Add address autocomplete and fix cart CORS issues`
- **Previous Work**: Image replacement, cart functionality, CORS fixes

### External Resources
- **Pexels API**: Used for product image sourcing
- **Unsplash API**: Alternative image source
- **USPS Address Validation**: Research for future integration
- **Google Places API**: Recommended for production enhancement

## Clarifications

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Address Autocomplete Approach**: Implemented local US cities database instead of external API for cost-effectiveness and speed
2. **State Selection**: Replaced text input with dropdown for data consistency
3. **ZIP Code Validation**: Real-time validation using regex patterns (5-digit and ZIP+4 formats)
4. **CORS Fix**: Added HEAD request support to cart API to resolve browser compatibility issues

### Future Enhancement Questions
1. **API Integration**: Should we prioritize Google Places API or USPS validation for production?
2. **International Support**: What countries should be prioritized for address expansion?
3. **Geolocation**: Should location detection be opt-in or automatically triggered?
4. **Address Storage**: Should we implement address history or frequently used addresses?

### Performance Considerations
- **Image Optimization**: All product images optimized to max 1200px, 85% quality JPEG
- **Autocomplete Efficiency**: City suggestions limited to 8 results for performance
- **TypeScript Benefits**: Enhanced development experience and reduced runtime errors
