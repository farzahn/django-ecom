## Context - Project Background

**Pasargad Prints** is a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce platform specifically designed for selling custom 3D printed items. The application follows a modern microservices architecture with Django REST Framework powering the backend API and React with TypeScript providing a responsive frontend user interface.

### Current Project State
- **Backend**: Fully implemented Django REST Framework API with comprehensive models for products, customers, orders, shopping carts, and shipping
- **Frontend**: Complete React application with modern state management using Zustand, TypeScript for type safety, and responsive design
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe payment processing with secure webhook handling
- **Shipping**: GoShippo API integration for real-time shipping rates and label generation
- **Security**: Advanced webhook security logging, CSRF protection, and comprehensive user activity tracking
- **Testing**: Extensive test suite covering E2E checkout flows, authentication fixes, and API integrations

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive indexing and optimized queries
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with enhanced customer profiles
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, performant React state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- **Security**: Enhanced webhook security with duplicate detection and signature verification
- **Deployment**: Docker-based containerization with production-ready configuration

### Recent Development Progress
The application has undergone significant enhancements including:
- Resolution of persistent 403 Forbidden authentication errors
- Implementation of comprehensive GoShippo shipping integration
- Enhanced user dashboard with profile management capabilities
- Advanced order lifecycle testing and webhook security improvements
- Comprehensive E2E testing framework for checkout processes

## Clarifications

### Technical Implementation Questions
1. **Styling Consistency**: Do the current index.css modifications maintain consistency with the established Tailwind CSS utility-first approach, or do they introduce custom CSS that could conflict with the design system?

2. **Dashboard Enhancement Scope**: What specific functionality has been added to the DashboardPage.tsx, and does it align with the comprehensive user profile management requirements outlined in the Customer model?

3. **Order Management Features**: What new capabilities have been implemented in OrdersPage.tsx, and do they support the advanced order lifecycle tracking including archiving and bulk operations?

4. **Authentication Testing Validation**: Is the test_final_login_fix.html file a comprehensive test of the recent authentication fixes, and should it be integrated into the formal test suite?

### Performance and Scalability Considerations
5. **Database Performance**: Are the current database queries optimized for the comprehensive indexing strategy implemented in the models, particularly for customer activity tracking and order management?

6. **Frontend Bundle Size**: How do the recent React component modifications impact the overall bundle size and loading performance, especially with the extensive state management requirements?

7. **Webhook Processing Load**: Is the current webhook security implementation capable of handling high-volume payment processing without creating bottlenecks in order fulfillment?

### Integration and Deployment Questions
8. **GoShippo Rate Accuracy**: Are the shipping rate calculations consistently accurate across different product dimensions and weights, particularly for the custom 3D printed items use case?

9. **Stripe Webhook Reliability**: How robust is the current webhook duplicate detection and retry mechanism under high-load production scenarios?

10. **Production Readiness**: Are all the recent modifications properly tested and ready for production deployment, or do they require additional validation and testing?

### Security and Compliance
11. **Data Privacy Compliance**: Does the comprehensive user activity tracking comply with data privacy regulations, and are there proper data retention and deletion policies in place?

12. **Payment Security**: Are all Stripe integration endpoints properly secured against potential vulnerabilities, including the webhook signature verification and payload validation?
